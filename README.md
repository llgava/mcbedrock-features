# MCBedrock Features

Since Microsoft does not share the feature files easily, here you will find exactly all the features responsible for setting the world in Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

All features are saved according to the Major version of the game, that is, feature updates that occur in Minor versions are updated in the repository as well. Version history is not maintained for outdated features.

> There are many features to understand how it works, contributions to have a complete documentation are very welcome!
